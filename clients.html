      <p>Fairhead Creative is, hands down, the best freelance relationship I’ve ever had. They were always on top of the project and very able to quickly turnaround beautiful deliverables based on my occasional abstract feedback. We’d supply a feeling and they’d create a physical manifestation of that in a high-quality deliverable. I can’t even imagine ever using anybody else.</p>

      <p>Fairhead Creative led our website redesign and was spectacular to work with. They were always on-time, helpful, knowledgeable and detail oriented.</p>
      <p>We wanted a site that was different from our competitors and spoke to our brand strategy. They listened to our needs and created a website that met all of our criteria our goals. They also trained us on features and designed the site so it is extremely easy to update and edit.</p>
      <p>In addition, they migrated over 250+ pages of our existing website to the new site. I would highly recommend Fairhead Creative for any of your website design and implementation needs.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Fairhead Creative is a pleasure to work with. We hired them to work on our corporate site as well as other graphic design requirements. They did a great job in bringing a bit of a personality to our website in addition to a design which we were very happy about.</p>
      <p>We ended up getting some of their suggestions for our product design as well and they had some great ones there as well.</p>
      <p>They spent time to make sure that our site adapts to smart phone resolutions (and not just shrink) but with swipe capability. They really do care about how users react and respond, and really enjoy their work and it was fun working with them.</p>
      <p>Adam's work is not complete until he says "smashing" a few times. Highly recommend him for his creative team and a well thought out implementation.</p>

      <p>Fairhead Creative is a skilled and creative team. Coding, illustrating, and architecting user experiences are their brushes. Websites are their canvas. Not only is it rare to have designers that can a coder and vice versa -- but also able to marry it while deeply understanding both the business and end-user side. They have an innate ability to empathize for the end-user and design with thoughtful purpose that evokes real emotion. I don't know what else to say -- Fairhead Creative is the real deal.</p>

      <p>Fairhead Creative stood out, so we decided to try them out. We haven't looked back since.</p>
      <p>They're excellent web designer/developers who have a deep understanding of how the web works. They're well organized and really passionate about what they do.</p> 
      <p>Fairhead Creative gets our best and warmest recommendations, and we're already looking forward to the next project together.</p>
