  <h2>The Process</h2>

  <p>The redesign of the LifeChurch.tv website started with a change of perspective. The “organization down” architecture of their previous website was replaced with “user up” architecture - organizing content around the user, making them feel central to the structure.</p>

  <p>Naming conventions were also challenged, to use language users are familiar with, rather than church jargon.</p>

  <p>Accompanying the shift in hierarchical perspective comes a shift in the way users navigate the site. Using existing data as our guide, the most frequently requested content is “promoted” to the top of the hierarchy, while the rest of the content’s links can be found within a menu.</p>

  <p>While designing the new site for LifeChurch.tv, we were intentional about asking questions visitors are asking, and turning those questions into the site’s navigation. Organizations like LifeChurch.tv have huge amounts of content for their users, each handled by different teams with their own processes, terms and goals.</p>

  <p>We designed the <strong>site structure based around what users are interested in</strong>, rather than around any kind of organizational structure. The two main sections were named ‘Ways to get involved’ and ‘A bit about us’.</p>

  <p>The first section is all about the user: people naturally find it easy to talk about themselves. This first section is the site's way of saying to its visitors, <strong>“so tell me about yourself.”</strong></p>

  <p>To continue the metaphor, the second section is where the church gets to respond, offering basic information about itself for anybody who wants to learn about the church as an organization. This section is akin to the visitor responding, <strong>“so enough about me, why don't you tell me about you?”</strong></p>

  <p>In addition to this architectural change, the entire site's visual design became content-focused. To us, good design says ‘look at me’ but <strong>great design says ‘look at this’.</strong> We were intentional about creating a design that truly complimented the type of content users were looking for, creating a more immersive experience.</p>

  <p>The site was custom-built to pre-generate content before users see it. This means that content is always lightning-fast to load, affordable to host, and almost impossible to hack. Content deployment is tied to a version control system, resulting in fewer errors and easy development.</p>

  <p>Content and structural changes can be made quickly and efficiently, giving the site a speed to market that most similarly sized websites don't have.</p>

  <figure class="lifechurchtv-sub3"></figure>

  <p>The new site experience was well received among visitors, and site usage doubled just a few months after launch. The site has since been blogged about in "Best Church Websites" articles, with great reviews.</p>

  <p>It's far from just a pretty face: <strong>it works.</strong></p>
